            <p>(Saturday - November 12, 1955, 10:03 PM) (The Clock Tower) (Marty #1 is in the Delorean, speeding at 88 miles per hour as in the ending of Back to the Future I.) Doc! (Marty #1 gets sent back to 1985. The 1955 Doc dances around with happiness because they were successful.)(Doc's House) (Marty is asleep in the chair. His feet are propped up using the hoverboard. Doc is still asleep on the couch. The TV is all snowy but suddenly the service starts working.) Hey kids what time is it? Howdy Doody time! (Doc wakes up and grabs his head, as though it hurts.) Great Scott! Ooh...Howdy Doody time!Hey, McFly, I thought I told you never to come in here. Well it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you? Well, Biff. Alright, punk, now… Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? (Marty runs out.)</p>

            <p>(Marty gives it more gas and suddenly there is a loud boom from the back of the car, and something falls off the car.) Damn! It blew the fuel injection manifold. Strong stuff all right. (holds up the broken part to show Marty.) It'll take me a month to rebuild it. A month? Doc, you're gonna get shot on Monday! (moves over to his desk by the window) I know, I know, I know! I wish...wait. I've got it! We can roll it down a steep hill...no, we'd never find a smooth enough surface. Unless...of course...ice. Eyes widening. We can wait until winter...when the lake freezes over... Winter! Doc! Monday! It's three days away!Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. (he takes a drink and then goes over to Lorraine's table.) Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. What? Oh, what I meant to day was… Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and you're my density. I mean, I'm your destiny.</p>

            <p>(They pull a switch and the Delorean rolls slowly down the tracks.) Wow, that worked great. I've at least gotta tell her goodbye. C'mon...Doc...I mean, think about it...what are you gonna say to her, I gotta go back to the future?? I mean, she's not gonna understand that, Doc. How long I been with ya and I don't even understand it?? (pause) Doc. Listen. Maybe we could...I dunno, maybe we could just take Clara with us. To the future? You've reminded me, Marty, I'm a scientist so I must be scientific about this. I cautioned you about disruption of the continuum for your own personal benefit. Therefore I must do no less. We will proceed as planned, and as soon as we return to 1985 we'll destroy this infernal machine. Traveling through time has become much too painful. (he walks away)You don't have to remind me of that, Doc! Here's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact. I'll stay here and try to repair the shortened time circuits. That way we don't risk anyone else stealing the time machine, and I won't risk accidentally running into my other self. Your other self? Yes! There are now 2 of me here... (During the following Doc turns to face the camera as if he is talking to the audience.) ...and there are 2 of you here. (He runs down the street, Marty follows.) The other me, is the Dr Emmett Brown from 1955, the younger me...(He turns around and runs back to the camera.) ...that helps the younger you get back to 1985! Remember the lightning bolt at the clock tower? Yeah.</p>

            <p>All right, so that's why you've gotta come back with me. (confused) Where? (in a what's-wrong-with-you voice) Back to the future! (with conviction) Right. Let's get going. (he sets down his glass) Great.Clara! (She shrugs and shouts above the din.) I love you. (into walkie-talkie) Doc, Doc! What's happening? (into walkie-talkie) It's Clara, she's on the train! Clara! (to himself) Perfect.(o.s) Where's that punk Calvin Klein? (o.s) How am I supposed to know? I ain't his secretary. (Cut to the Gang) Well go find him. He cost me three hundred bucks damage to my car, and I owe him a knuckle sandwich. Get going! 3-(offers Biff the bottle) Here you go Biff! (The gang start to walk off.) You coming?</p>

            <p>(backs down) Look, just leave my friends alone. (he turns to walk away) What's wrong, dude, you yella? (Marty stops in mid-step and turns slowly to face Tannen.) That's what I thought. Yellow belly. Nobody... calls me yellow. Let's finish it...right now. Uh, not now, Buford...Marshall's got our guns.(The screen is "interrupted" by another video waiter on the same video. This one looks like the Ayatollah Khomeini.) "Ayatollah Khomeini"You must try the hot Satan special! (The two waiters begin arguing amongst themselves.) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (The video waiters shut up.) All I want is a Pepsi. (A Pepsi in a futuristic bottle appears out of the counter. Marty picks it up and looks at it.)</p>

            <p>(os) Yeah! Everything except the boots, Doc. They're kind of tight! I dunno, are you sure this stuff is authentic? Of course. Haven't you ever seen a Western? (Marty comes out of the bathroom and he's dressed in a frilly pink western shirt and red-ish pants that look very un-authentic.) Yeah, I have Doc, but Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this. Clint who?You'll find out. You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother? (glances at Lorraine) Yeah, I think maybe you do. Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you. You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.(v.o) Burn it! (w.t) Check! (Marty kicks up the hoverboard and spots an old bucket. He puts the almanac in the bucket and takes out the matchbox he took from Biff's Pleasure Paradise. He lights a match and starts to burn the book. He then looks at the matchbox. The words are starting to change! Eventually they change from “Biff's Pleasure Paradise” to “Biff Auto Dealing”. Marty then pulls out the newspaper. The headline changes from “George McFly Murdered” to “George McFly Honored”.) (w.t) Doc, Doc, the newspaper changed! Now my father's alive! That means everything's back to normal, right?
